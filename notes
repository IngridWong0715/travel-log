ISSUES:
1. - run shotgun -p 3000
    - to specify port
- but still mention it; is something wrong with my rvm?
    - if I run rvm â€”version
        - gets error: Warning! PATH is not properly set up, /Users/ingridooo/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.3/bin is not at first place

2. nested routes:
  - "/new" works but not "/trips/new"
  - ditto with edit
  SOLUTION : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24153013/stylesheet-not-applying-to-sinatra-erb-views
  => change to absolute path

3.Flash message styling not working

4. Logged_in? and current_user logic (double check)

TO WORK ON:

2. Expand trip: one way or aller-retour?
