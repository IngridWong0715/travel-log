ISSUES:
1. - run shotgun -p 3000
    - to specify port
- but still mention it; is something wrong with my rvm?
    - if I run rvm â€”version
        - gets error: Warning! PATH is not properly set up, /Users/ingridooo/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.3.3/bin is not at first place

2. nested routes:
  - "/new" works but not "/trips/new"
  - ditto with edit

TO WORK ON:
1. Adding sinatra-flash to
  - user signup & create new trip: already exists (remove the view pages)

2. Expand trip: one way or aller-retour?

3. Dont' really need the show page... ?
